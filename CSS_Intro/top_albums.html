        <h2>Blond - Frank Ocean</h2>
        <p>Featured track - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BME88lS6aVY">Self Control</a></p>
        <p>I grew up on Guam and moved to a lot of different countries and states after graduating from high school.
            This song really captures what it's like to love someone in your hometown. There's an odd magic when you
            visit your hometown, and old friendships light up like a campfire coming back to life.</p>
        <p>On a technical and musical note, blond is full of very interesting production on top of thought-provoking,
            storytelling lyrics.</p>

        <h2>In Rainbows - Radiohead</h2>
        <p>Featured track - <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOLMuK74fVw&list=PLpuAQIiG6Znp_SRcaF-mJ8q1ef-7yeHtO&index=5">All I
                Need</a></p>
        <p>Such a simple hook. Really love the interplaying bass and synth-sounds. Vocals are really mesmerizing, and in
            a weird way the melody matches the words in the chorus "You are all I need"</p>

        <h2>The 20/20 Experience - Justin Timberlake</h2>
        <p>Featured track <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbP99oQSG_Q&list=PLH_QLWlQVieVLWgw2YvmXIhcTX3XqqY56&index=11">Blue
                Ocean Floor</a></p>
        <p>Another track with seemingly simple sounds behind an emotional vocal performance. There are so many dreamy
            digital sounds underneath the vocals.
            Reverse-delay for the main violin-ish melody, and a deep round bubbling from the bass...the song really
            reminds me of being in the ocean. Not to mention the echoing in the chorus.

        <h2>Parachutes - Coldplay</h2>
        <p>Featured track<a href="https://youtu.be/yKNxeF4KMsY?si=i8e5-G0IAjiC475o">Yellow</a></p>
        <p>Yellow is a classic for me. I remember when I was a kid and my dad would practice singing this. It was one of
            my favorites growing up. At this point I've been playing guitar for 15 years and sing this song too. It's
            got such a simple chord progression but the timing and vocal melodies are quite interesting. Most noteworthy
            though is the writing point of reusing "Yellow". "It was all Yellow." "You were all Yellow." "It was called
            Yellow." How on earth would a normal band get away with that kind of writing theme?</p>

        <h2>Room for Squares - John Mayer</h2>
        <p>Featured track<a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1W2UddURXI&list=OLAK5uy_mw6gr8JtGRz2JrzlXQbNfDRVJj3Boj2T4">No
                Such Thing</a></p>
        <p>No Such Thing is probably the first John Mayer I can remember. It's odd that I didn't know it's name until I
            was in high school, 10+ years after Room For Squares was released. First time I heard some wicked guitar
            playing and singing at the same time, and the music really just sounds like Myspace and Neopets.com to me
            haha. Reminders of Middle School. Room For Squares features a lot of great acoustic guitar playing.</p>
