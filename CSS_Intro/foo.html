        <pre>
            When I was a young man my father took me into the city to see a marching band.
        He said, "Son when you grow would you be the savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?"
        He said, "Will you defeat them?
        Your demons, and all the non-believers
        The plans that they have made?"
        "Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
        To lead you in the summer
        To join the black parade"
        </pre>
