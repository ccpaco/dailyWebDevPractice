        <h2>Blond - Frank Ocean</h2>
        <p>Featured track - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BME88lS6aVY">Self Control</a></p>
        <p>I grew up on Guam and moved to a lot of different countries and states after graduating from high school.
            This song really captures what it's like to love someone in your hometown. There's an odd magic when you
            visit your hometown, and old friendships light up like a campfire coming back to life.</p>
        <p>On a technical and musical note, blond is full of very interesting production on top of thought-provoking,
            storytelling lyrics.</p>

        <h2>In Rainbows - Radiohead</h2>
        <p>Featured track - <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOLMuK74fVw&list=PLpuAQIiG6Znp_SRcaF-mJ8q1ef-7yeHtO&index=5">All I
                Need</a></p>
        <p>Such a simple hook. Really love the interplaying bass and synth-sounds. Vocals are really mesmerizing, and in
            a weird way the melody matches the words in the chorus "You are all I need"</p>

        <h2>The 20/20 Experience - Justin Timberlake</h2>
        <p>Featured track <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbP99oQSG_Q&list=PLH_QLWlQVieVLWgw2YvmXIhcTX3XqqY56&index=11">Blue
                Ocean Floor</a></p>
        <p>Another track with seemingly simple sounds behind an emotional vocal performance. There are so many dreamy
            digital sounds underneath the vocals.
            Reverse-delay for the main violin-ish melody, and a deep round bubbling from the bass...the song really
            reminds me of being in the ocean. Not to mention the echoing in the chorus.
